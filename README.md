uHbench map
===========

**A map of known places where [urban hacker benches](http://xuv.be/uH-bench-open-source-public-bench.html) have been built**

The map: http://xuv.github.io/uhbench-map/map.html

*− Have you built a uHbench? Want to have youn instance on the map?*  
Add an [issue](https://github.com/xuv/uhbench/issues) with the name(s) of the builder(s), location and date
or clone this repo and update the data.tsv
or send a mail to juego ~at~ requiem4tv.com with those informations.

*− Why this map?*  
A workshop and exhibition of the uHbench project has been sceduled at [Constant VZW](http://constantvzw.org/site/uHbench-workshop.html) and for that they asked me to produce 2 posters that will be displayed along the benches built for the occasion. One of the poster would obviously be the instruction sheet, then for the second one, I hesitated, and went for a representation of how far this project has reached since it's creation in 2012.

*−How this map was done?*  
Since it needed to be printed, I was willing to have a full vector file as an output. I also wanted to have an online version of it that could grow easily and be updated as more benches would be built. And since I was lurking D3js for a while now, this seemed a great opportunity to try my hands at it. And I could not be more pleased.

*−Licenses?*  
Except the content of the `d3` & `topopjson` folders, the files of this project are released under a [Free Art License 1.3 ](http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/)
